#  _Digital Image Process_ Project 1

## Description
Use the image processing method to extract the ridges in the fingerprint image and output a mask. However, there is a high-resolution fingerprint image acquisition device that randomly applies a noise during the image acquisition due to the device itself. You are required to first eliminate this noise through the knowledge you have learned in class, and then extract the ridge.

## Goal

1. Eliminate the random noise (Salt, Pepper, Gauss)
2.
